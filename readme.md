# modular_webrust

Using [Nickel](https://github.com/nickel-org/nickel.rs) to build modular web service in Rust. I am using MySQL database for this case. You can generate the database first and sample data with [dbmigrate](https://github.com/Keats/dbmigrate).

## Installation
- Copy env.ini.sample to env.ini
- Fill the database detail in env.ini file
- Run build command
```
$ cargo build
```
### TO DO
A lot of things to do :p

### NOTES TO RUST DEVELOPER
